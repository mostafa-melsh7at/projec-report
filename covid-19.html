            During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and
            "Wuhan coronavirus"
            The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020.[36] Tedros Adhanom
            explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31
            December 2019).
            The WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public
            communications.

                    20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR).[80] The Pango tool

            COVID-19 can affect the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract
            (windpipe and lungs).[81] The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host
            cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the
            surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs.[82] The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a
            "spike" (peplomer) to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell.[83]

            Whether SARS-CoV-2 is able to invade the nervous system remains unknown however it is clear that many people
            with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in the CNS of the
            majority of COVID-19 people with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in
            the brains of those who have died from COVID-19, but these results need to be confirmed.[84] Loss of smell
            results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the
            olfactory neurons.[85] SARS-CoV-2 could cause respiratory failure through affecting the brain stem as other
            coronaviruses have been found to invade the CNS. While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of
            autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of
            peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.[86][87][88] The virus may also enter the
            bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an
            infected white blood cell.[84]


            Tropism and multiple organ injuries in SARS-CoV-2 infection
            The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of
            gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium[89] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small
            intestine.[90]

            The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system.[91] An acute
            cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China,[92] and is more
            frequent in severe disease.[93] Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic
            inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries
            may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.[91] ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and
            are involved in heart function.[91][94] A high incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism have been
            found people transferred to Intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 infections, and may be related to poor
            prognosis.[95] Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels caused by
            blood clots) are thought to play a significant role in mortality, incidences of clots leading to pulmonary
            embolisms, and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in people
            infected with SARS-CoV-2. Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the
            body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in
            which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia.[96] Furthermore, microvascular
            blood vessel damage has been reported in a small number of tissue samples of the brains – without detected
            SARS-CoV-2 – and the olfactory bulbs from those who have died from COVID-19.[97][98][99]

            Another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys.[96] Early reports show that up to 30%
            of hospitalized patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys,
            including some persons with no previous kidney problems.[100]

            Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing
            inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.

    <div id="Pregnancy response">

        <p>
            Nowadays, there are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that they are prone
            to suffering from complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have
            been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures.[112]

            Physiological responses to pregnancy can include:

            Immunological: The immunological response to COVID-19, like other viruses, depends on a working immune
            system. It adapts during pregnancy to allow the development of the fetus whose genetic load is only
            partially shared with their mother, leading to a different immunological reaction to infections during the
            course of pregnancy.[112]
            Respiratory: Many factors can make pregnant women more vulnerable to hard respiratory infections. One of
            them is the total reduction of the lungs' capacity and inability to clear secretions.[112]
            Coagulation: During pregnancy, there are higher levels of circulating coagulation factors, and the
            pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be implicated. The thromboembolic events with associated mortality
            are a risk for pregnant women.[112]
            However, from the evidence base, it is difficult to conclude whether pregnant women are at increased risk of
            grave consequences of this virus.[112]

            In addition to the above, other clinical studies have proved that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the period of
            pregnancy in different ways. On the one hand, there is little evidence of its impact up to 12 weeks
            gestation. On the other hand, COVID-19 infection may cause increased rates of unfavorable outcomes in the
            course of the pregnancy. Some examples of these could be fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and
            perinatal mortality, which refers to the fetal death past 22 or 28 completed weeks of pregnancy as well as
            the death among live-born children up to seven completed days of life.

        <p>
            Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing
            a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing
            potential exposure durations,[138] washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds,
            practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed
            hands.[139][140]

            Those diagnosed with COVID-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except
            to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the
            healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes
            with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household
            items.[141][142]

            The first COVID-19 vaccine was granted regulatory approval on 2 December by the UK medicines regulator
            MHRA.[143] It was evaluated for emergency use authorization (EUA) status by the US FDA, and in several other
            countries.[144] Initially, the US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication
            for prevention of COVID-19, before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a
            clinical trial.[145][146] Without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key
            part of managing COVID-19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as "flattening the
            curve".[147] This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being
            overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of active cases, and delaying additional cases until effective
            treatments or a vaccine become available.
